# Load the libraries into this R session
library(raster)       #Main raster library with nearly all functions used in this analysis
library(rgdal)        #Spatial library - most functions used from rgdal are for vectors (shapefiles)
library(rasterVis)    #Useful for raster visualizations
library(maps)         #Has a database of maps. I use this to add a map to my raster to visualize land boundaries
library(rgeos)        #Need this library for topology operations on geometries
library(dplyr)        #NOT spatial - this is a data wrangling library
library(RColorBrewer) #Also not spatial - used to set the spectral color scheme
