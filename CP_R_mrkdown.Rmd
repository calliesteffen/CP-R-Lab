```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
# Load the libraries into this R session
library(raster)       #Main raster library with nearly all functions used in this analysis
library(rgdal)        #Spatial library - most functions used from rgdal are for vectors (shapefiles)
library(rasterVis)    #Useful for raster visualizations
library(maps)         #Has a database of maps. I use this to add a map to my raster to visualize land boundaries
library(rgeos)        #Need this library for topology operations on geometries
library(dplyr)        #NOT spatial - this is a data wrangling library
library(RColorBrewer) #Also not spatial - used to set the spectral color scheme 
```

Set Color Palette for Later
```{r}
# view some color palettes
# display.brewer.all()
# rainbow color scheme
cols = rev(colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(11, 'Spectral'))(255)) 

#setting smaller margins for plotting
par(mar=c(2,2,1,1))
```


Import Raster Data
```{r}

all_threats <- raster()


```
